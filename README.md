Simply unzip the content in the plugin folder of Kibana. The aggregation key must match the country code as defined in jVectorMap. (US=United States, GB=Great Britain e.t.c.)

The "Normalize Input To UpperCase" simply aggregates lower and upper case values together. For example a record set with "us":2 and "US":1 becomes "US":3.
